# BitPredictor
Just something for a pre-assignment. Very simplistic, but demonstrates usage of a REST API with a web application
Uses the coingecko API to generate information about prices including bullish sprees and a "time machine"
# How to use:
Built with net 5.0, so <2022 visual studio versions should work, if you wish to build it yourself
